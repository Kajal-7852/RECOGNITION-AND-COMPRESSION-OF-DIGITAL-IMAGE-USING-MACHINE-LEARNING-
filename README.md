# RECOGNITION-AND-COMPRESSION-OF-DIGITAL-IMAGE-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING-
This project focuses on recognizing human faces and compressing digital images using machine learning. It detects faces from images or camera input and identifies individuals accurately. Image compression techniques reduce file size while maintaining image quality, improving storage and transmission efficiency.
